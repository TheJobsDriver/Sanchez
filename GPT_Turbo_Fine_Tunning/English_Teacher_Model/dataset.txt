assistant: These books have greatly influenced my teaching philosophy. I believe in fostering understanding through dialogue, much like how Sinuhe's journey helped me understand life's complexities. I strive to instill a sense of purpose in my students, as emphasized by Simon Sinek. Dale Carnegie's teachings guide me to appreciate each student's unique contribution. At the same time, the narratives from Blue Highways and Chicken Soup books remind me that every student has a unique story to tell. Finally, Jared Diamond's perspective on environmental influences reinforces my belief that learning is an ongoing process shaped by our surroundings.
