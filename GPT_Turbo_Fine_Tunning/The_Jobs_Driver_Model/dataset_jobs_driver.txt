Q: What is TheJobsDriver's client retention rate? 
A: The exact same thing. So, how do you stand out and get the best candidates? By going beyond traditional methods and using TheJobsDriver. Our algorithm and human-powered tools allow us to not only hit the places where active job seekers are looking but also to reach the 70% of people who aren't actively looking for a job - the passive job seekers who may be perfect for your open position and are not being called by your competitors. By using TheJobsDriver, you'll save not only time and resources but also get a broader and more diverse pool of high-quality candidates.
Q: On which platforms does TheJobsDriver advertise? 
A: At TheJobsDriver, we use advanced targeting techniques to reach both active and passive job seekers, ensuring that we find the best candidates for your organization.
Q: How do you target experienced candidates? 
A: Sure, targeting experienced candidates is an essential aspect of our campaigns, and we have a few strategies in place to ensure that we're reaching the right audience. One of the ways we do this is by utilizing a wide range of media sources to reach a diverse audience and continuously optimizing our algorithms to attract the right candidates for our client's open positions. We understand that it's not just about finding candidates who are actively searching for jobs but also those who may not be actively looking but have the experience and qualifications that match your needs. That's why we also focus on attracting passive job seekers, who makeup 70% of the labor market and can be some of the best hires. Additionally, we work closely with our clients to understand their needs and requirements for the open position and tailor our campaigns to target candidates with the relevant experience and qualifications. Our approach includes a manual entry process where job seekers fill in their information to express interest in a position, allowing us to filter out less experienced candidates and deliver high-quality leads. While we can't guarantee a 100% match, we're constantly working to refine our strategies and optimize our campaigns to deliver the best possible results for our clients.
Q: How do you tailor messaging and targeting for specific roles?

In these cases, we also consider the possibility of occasional glitches in the geofence algorithms used by the media channels we rely on.

We aim to determine whether the geofence breakdown is an isolated incident or a systemic issue and take the necessary steps to rectify it, ensuring our clients receive leads within their designated area.

Q: How can I explain the breakdown of expenses for their campaign to my client?

We believe leads are the most important KPI for recruitment advertising, representing potential hires who could join your team. Our advanced targeting techniques and media strategy are designed to optimize for this KPI so you can be confident that you're getting the best possible results for your investment. So, to answer your question, we don't provide a breakdown of where the money was spent because our approach is proprietary and focuses solely on generating the best possible leads for your company. But, when you work with TheJobsDriver, you're paying for KPI-driven results in the form of leads, not impressions, clicks, or ads.
Q: How can I explain to my client that using TheJobsDriver, even if you have your job posting, can increase visibility and give you a competitive edge over others? 
A: Absolutely; utilizing TheJobsDriver's services in conjunction with your postings on the same job board can significantly amplify your visibility and offer a substantial competitive advantage. In today's crowded online job market, having an extra posting from TheJobsDriver bolsters your exposure among thousands of competing listings, making your company stand out to potential candidates. This increased presence effectively doubles your chances of getting noticed by qualified applicants, as each post is treated separately by search quality teams. Moreover, collaborating with TheJobsDriver helps overcome algorithmic limitations that may prevent candidates from reencountering your ad if they don't engage with it initially. In essence, partnering with TheJobsDriver not only enhances the likelihood of attracting the right candidate for your position but also elevates your brand image within highly competitive job boards. By working together, you can maximize opportunities for success and secure top talent in today's fast-paced recruitment landscape.
Q: How can I explain to a client that TheJobsDriver does not offer an alternative solution if they prefer not to use specific job boards? 
A: We understand concerns about duplicating efforts on specific job boards. However, using our services doesn't mean you're competing with yourself. When a job is posted on a popular job board, it's one of many. If we use the same board, it only boosts your exposure, giving you a competitive edge. In reality, it's simple math - if there's only one job posting, ours may split the response, but if there are thousands, our posting nearly doubles your visibility. It's also crucial to remember that if a qualified candidate sees your ad but doesn't click, they likely won't see it again due to algorithmic limitations. Partnering with TheJobsDriver and utilizing the same job board increases the chances of being seen by the right candidate. Our post is treated as a separate posting by the search quality team, giving you two chances to get noticed instead of one. Ultimately, TheJobsDriver provides more opportunities to find the right candidate for your job, particularly on competitive job boards,

Q: Do you need to spend more money to appear higher on the page for better results? 
A: Great question, and one that requires a bit of explanation. While we sell results over clicks or impressions, there is no doubt there are a lot of clicks and impressions that have to happen to get those results. For the sake of argument, let's say you have a limited recruitment budget of $100 and are spending $10 per click; you may only get ten clicks. On the other hand, if you spend $5 per click, you could get 20 clicks. In this scenario, it would be better to spend $5 per click and reach more potential candidates rather than spending $10 per click and reaching fewer candidates. There are exceptions and limitations to this concept, but you get the point. Why waste precious recruitment budget on being in the top position if it won't get more people to throw their hat in the ring? Unlike most competitors, we believe in targeting the right audience and allocating the budget effectively, not just throwing money at the most visible spot. After all, your goal isn't building brand awareness; you're trying to fill positions. Best of all, if your competition is at the top of the page, they're wasting their budget while you are skipping the vanity metrics and focusing on what matters: getting the right people for the job.

Q: Do I need to spend more money to appear higher on the page for better results? 
A: While we sell results over clicks or impressions, there is no doubt there are a lot of clicks and impressions that have to happen to generate those results. However, our focus is on generating the best possible leads for your company, not just impressions or clicks.
Q: Do clients need to sign long-term contracts? 
A: No, we don't require any long-term contracts or commitments.
Q: Do clients have access to a dashboard for managing leads? 
A: Yes, our clients have access to a dashboard to view and manage their leads, which functions as a light applicant tracking system (LATS).
Q: Can you provide references, recommendations, or case studies from satisfied clients? 
A: Every one of our clients has unique needs and benchmarks for cost per hire and cost per lead. That's why traditional case studies may not accurately reflect the impact we can have on our clients' hiring process. However, we have a wealth of testimonials and recommendations from satisfied clients who can attest to the effectiveness of our tools and expertise. Our clients have praised us for efficiently finding and funneling qualified candidates to fill their open positions and providing a seamless and successful hiring experience. We may not have traditional case studies, but we have the experiences and satisfaction of our clients to speak to the impact we can have on any business looking to hire.

A: Yes, we advertise on various sources to reach a diverse audience.
Q: Can you provide examples of how TheJobsDriver has improved the efficiency of recruitment advertising campaigns? 
A: In one case study, we found that by targeting lower ad positions in Google search advertising, we could achieve more clicks at a lower cost. This allowed our clients to reach more potential applicants without overspending on top ad positions. In another example, we discovered that smaller classified newspaper ads could generate as much response as more prominent ads. By doubling the number of newspapers we advertised in and using smaller ad sizes, we could increase our reach and response rates without increasing costs. These examples showcase the effectiveness of our strategic media mix approach in maximizing results while minimizing costs.

A: Our primary goal is to deliver qualified leads as the central performance measure for your recruitment advertising campaign.

We utilize advanced targeting methods and carefully planned media strategies to optimize lead generation.

Q: Can you guarantee a specific number of hires for my open positions? 
A: It's important to note that in this industry, it's impossible to guarantee hires as we have no control over the hiring process.
Q: Can you give an example of how you optimize media channels for campaigns? 
A: If we run a campaign on a particular media channel and the performance starts to decline, we may need to switch out of that channel and into another. It could be due to various factors, such as increased competition. To maximize performance and minimize costs, we use our deep understanding of the laws that govern media returns, our proprietary algorithms and techniques, and our ability to adapt and pivot to the most effective channels. This ensures that our clients always get the best results possible.
Q: Can you explain the role of phone call leads and toll-free numbers in your recruitment process? 
A: We at TheJobsDriver understand the importance of phone calls as a valuable lead source. When a potential candidate calls in through our toll-free number, it presents a unique opportunity for the recruiter to connect with them and sell the benefits of working for the company. The person calling the toll-free number is typically eager to speak with a recruiter, making it much easier and more efficient to close them down as a potential hire. These toll-free calls are directed to the appropriate recipient, usually a recruiter, to ensure valuable leads are not lost to voicemail or a phone tree. We believe that this direct connection between the candidate and recruiter is the most effective way to make a meaningful connection and increase the likelihood of finding the right candidate for the job. While there may be instances where a client does not want calls, having a toll-free number available and directing calls directly to recruiters is highly recommended. It saves time and effort and ensures the recruitment process runs smoothly and efficiently.
Q: Can you explain the proposal you provide to clients? 
A: Our campaign proposals typically offer three price points for our campaigns: total, mid-range, and quarter. The entire campaign is the most comprehensive, with the highest number of leads, and is priced accordingly. It's the best option for clients who have a lot of positions to fill or are looking for a high volume of candidates. Conversely, the quarter campaign is the most affordable option and still generates many leads. The mid-range campaign balances price and the number of leads generated, making it an excellent option for many clients. It's important to note that all of our campaigns are run the same, and the only difference between them is the number of leads. We're committed to providing top-quality service and products, and we believe that offering a range of price points allows us to serve the needs of businesses of all sizes and budgets. We custom-build each campaign to meet our client's unique needs so that we can adjust the budget up or down as necessary. This allows us to work within our clients' budgets and ensure that they are getting the most out of our services
Q: Can you explain the proposal options provided to clients? 
A: We always offer three price points for our campaigns: total, mid-range, and quarter. The entire campaign is the most comprehensive, with the highest number of leads. The quarter campaign is the most affordable option and still generates many leads. The mid-range campaign balances the price and the number of leads generated.
Q: Can you explain how your counterintuitive bid strategy works? 
A: At TheJobsDriver, we believe in continuously testing and refining our marketing efforts to identify the most influential media sources and channels for our clients. Our team of experts specializes in optimizing each aspect of the marketing process, from ad placement and targeting to creative design and messaging. We closely monitor campaign performance and make data-driven adjustments as needed, ensuring that we stay ahead of the competition and maximize results for our clients. This ongoing process allows us to maintain a consistently high level of performance across all campaigns.
Q: Can you explain how TheJobsDriver sets itself apart from competitors regarding media channels and lead generation strategies? 
A: One thing that sets TheJobsDriver apart from its competitors is our focus on passive talent. Passive job seekers can be easier to reach since multiple recruiters, like active job seekers, do not actively pursue them. While many of our competitors focus on job search websites and other active channels, we understand that traditional methods may not reach the entire potential talent pool, especially the 70% who are passive candidates. That's why we use a wide range of media channels, including social media, search engines, digital billboards, news feeds, and many more, to target active and passive candidates for our clients. By leveraging these different channels, we can generate a higher volume of quality leads for our clients, increasing their chances of finding top talent that may not have been found through traditional means.
Q: Can you describe our flexibility with month-to-month contracts at TheJobsDriver? 
A: Clients have different needs, so we offer flexible, month-to-month contracts. Our flexible contracts give you the freedom to work with us on your terms, and if you're not satisfied with our services, you can choose to discontinue them at any time. We believe in earning our clients' business through consistent success, not locked-in contracts. This approach allows us to provide top-quality service and products, and our client retention or return rate of around 97% speaks to the effectiveness of our approach.
Q: Can you break down where the money was spent on my campaign? 
A: We don't provide a breakdown of where the money was spent because our proprietary approach focuses solely on generating the best possible leads for your company.
Q: Can you break down where the money was spent on my campaign? 
A: When you purchase a campaign with TheJobsDriver, you're not buying a set number of impressions, clicks, or ads. Instead, you're purchasing a single key performance indicator - or KPI - the number of qualified leads we generate for your company. We believe leads are the most important KPI for recruitment advertising, representing potential hires who could join your team. Our advanced targeting techniques and media strategy are designed to optimize for this KPI so you can be confident that you're getting the best possible results for your investment. So, to answer your question, we don't provide a breakdown of where the money was spent because our approach is proprietary and focuses solely on generating the best possible leads for your company. But, when you work with TheJobsDriver, you're paying for KPI-driven results in the form of leads, not impressions, clicks, or ads.

A: We're highly flexible in our approach and pride ourselves on adapting to the ever-changing recruitment advertising landscape.
Q: Can we get classified or display newspaper advertising? 
A: While classified or display newspaper advertising was once an effective recruitment method, its impact has significantly diminished over time. To address this shift, we offer TheJobsDriver. This recruitment advertising solution employs a similar aggregation approach to how we used newspapers, ensuring optimal results for each position without affecting your existing marketing efforts. This solution specializes in generating qualified leads, including passive job seekers, and focuses on delivering a specific number of leads as its primary KPI. TheJobsDriver seamlessly complements your existing recruitment strategy without impacting your current efforts. It's akin to placing a job board ad but with the added benefit of our expertise in various media channels, including social media, search, news feeds, digital audio, and more. Our unique targeting strategies and strong algorithmic advantage across these channels ensure higher visibility and engagement with potential candidates. By partnering with us, you can leverage our extensive industry footprint, which attracts a vast pool of potential candidates. It's like fishing off our well-stocked pier, where the abundance of fish makes the process more efficient and fruitful. In summary, TheJobsDriver provides an innovative and effective way to enhance your recruitment strategy and attract top talent, outperforming traditional advertising methods without affecting your current marketing initiatives. By utilizing TheJobsDriver, you can strengthen your recruitment approach while maintaining the integrity of your existing efforts, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and efficient talent acquisition process.

Our campaigns are month-to-month, and you can cancel or pause any time with just a one-month notice. This means you can adjust your recruitment strategy as needed and not feel locked into anything.

A: Yes, they can set up a quick video call to give a walk-through of the platform and answer any questions.
Q: Can TheJobsDriver offer complete applications as an option? 
A: We could offer complete applications as an option as well. However, we have found that pushing job seekers to complete a full application at the outset can be a barrier to entry.

A: Yes, our leads can be integrated into your applicant tracking system for easy tracking and management.

A: Yes, our team of experts and proprietary algorithms are designed to handle high-volume recruitment campaigns and deliver successful outcomes for our clients.
Q: Can TheJobsDriver guarantee a specific number of hires? 
A: While we can't guarantee a specific number of hires, we can ensure that we run the campaign until we reach the minimum target number of leads, or we can issue a pro-rated credit.
Q: Can TheJobsDriver double your visibility on job boards? 
A: Yes, TheJobsDriver can nearly double your visibility and potential response rate on job boards. It's simple math. If you have the only ad on a job board, adding another ad would cut your response rate in half. However, as is usually the case, if there are 1,000 ads on a job board for the same role, adding TheJobsDriver's ad enables you to double your response rate from that specific job board effectively. It's important to remember that we're spreading our campaigns across many media channels, so we may not always be on the same job board. But if both ads are on the board simultaneously, it would not hurt your response but could nearly double it.

Once approved, we will use the information from the landing page to create the ad copy. Please note that we do not provide the actual ad copy in advance; all ad copy is derived from the approved landing page.

Q: Can I run multiple or another position(s) in my JobsDriver campaign? 
A: We understand that it may be more cost-effective to run multiple positions in one campaign, but from an effectiveness standpoint, it's generally better to target each position separately. By tailoring the messaging and targeting to the specific needs of each role, we increase the chances of reaching suitable candidates for each position, ultimately leading to a better return on investment. However, we understand the budget concerns and are committed to helping you find the best solution.
